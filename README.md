This repository contains various files and datasets relevant to my master's thesis.
The thesis is publically availible at link.to.thesis

The main code that decides inclusion in a regular ratio set is RegularLanguageRatioSetAutomataGenerator.py.
This program is used by many of the specific examples in the folders of the repository.

The folder Fibbinary contains code to decide inclusion in the ratio set $R(\texttt{FIB})$ as well as $R(\texttt{FIB}, \mathbb{N})$.
It also includes code that finds approximations to a real number using elements of $R(\texttt{FIB})$.

The folder PalindromicMultiples contains code to decide inclusion in the ratio sets $R(\texttt{PAL}_2, \mathbb{N})$ and $R(\texttt{APAL}_2, \mathbb{N})$.

The folder StartingWithOne contains code to decide inclusion in the ratio sets $R(A_{k, 1})$.

The folder utilities contains various small utility functions for analyzing the results of RegularLanguageRatioSetAutomataGenerator.py.
It is not required for reproduction of the data presented in the thesis.
